					<p class="font-50">Campus presentation</p>
					<br /><br />
					<p class="font-40">Purpose of the campus presentation:</p>
					<p class="font-23">Based on the knowledge of the synthetic biology, we prepared questions regarding the nucleic
						acid tests, especially that for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and invited the faculty and students of
						our university to take the survey. We believe that this survey can broaden their horizon of the background
						knowledge in the synthetic biology, cultivate their interest, stimulate their curiosity, and arouse their further
						discussion and thinking. The faculty and students with different majors and grades would have an comprehensive
						understanding of our project.</p>
						<br /><br />
					<p class="font-40">Campus presentation targets:</p>
					<p class="font-30">Young faculty and students of different majors and grades in Northeast Forestry University.</p>

				<div class="width60-no-margin-text">
					<p class="font-50">Why did we share the project with them?</p>
					<p class="font-30">①University campus flow is large and has high density. Once an outbreak of an infectious
						disease occurred, the detection and quarantine would be very difficult. Quick detection is crucial; however,
						detection
						time could be long, with high demand for technical staff and resources. Young faculty and students have strong
						ability to accept new things, so our virus detection method is very suitable for the scenarios in universities.</p>
					<br /><br />
					<p class="font-30">②In addition, college students have a reasonable level of basic knowledge in biology, which
						would help them to understand the concept of synthetic biology. We could communicate with the faculty and
						students to deliver the knowledge of synthetic biology. Meanwhile, the faculty and students could easily
						understand our
						project design and provide their feedbacks. This kind of introduction and communication played an important role
						in promoting our project.</p>
					<br /><br />
					<p class="font-30">③Young people have strong ability in learning, understanding and spreading new
						knowledge.Therefore, our interactions with them could help us to propagate our project and the concept of
						synthetic biology
						to their families and friends.</p>

					<p class="font-50">Contents:</p>
					<p class="font-30">First, Shuhan Liu introduced the current situation of the COVID-19 pandemic around the world.
						To date, there are accumulatively (number???) confirmed cases of COVID-19 in our city, Harbin. All faculty and
						students need to take nucleic acid tests multiple times consecutively. Due to the large number of people, it is
						relatively slow to obtain the nucleic acid test results. Therefore, starting from the limitations of the severe
						acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection methods in our campus, Shuhan Liu described to
						the audiences the advantages of our approach, including its convenience and high sensitivity, compared with the
						currently used ones.</p>
					<br /><br />
					<p class="font-30">Second, from the perspective of synthetic biology, Shuhan Liu introduced the history and
						purpose of the iGEM, and presented the design of our project in detail. She described the principles of the
						selective amplification of recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), chain cutting and chain replacement with
						the cooperation of two enzymes, nCas9 and Phi29, as well as the amplification of G-quadruplex by rolling circle
						amplification (RCA), employed in our nucleic acid detection method.</p>
					<br /><br />
					<p class="font-30">Third, the NEFU_CHINA 2021 team members discussed the visual detection platform based on
						G-quadruplex with the faculty and students who participated in the presentation. Yang Liu, a student majoring in
						Biotechnology of the grade 2021, gave his opinion. He believed that the G-quadruplex-based visual detection
						platform was very suitable for large-scale rapid detection. If it can be put into use, it will bring considerable
						convenience for the detection of nucleic acid viruses in our country and even the whole world. He indicated that
						the lecture made him interested in synthetic biology, and hoped that he could conduct research in this direction
						in future and contribute to its development./p>
						<br /><br />
						<p class="font-30">Finally, Shuhan Liu demonstrated a simple version of the detection process to the students
							attending the presentation, and let them try it by themselves. The NEFU_CHINA 2021 team members provided
							certificates to the students who were actively involved in the presentation, and distributed souvenirs to the
							audiences.</p>

					<p class="font-50">End:</p>
					<p class="font-30">Through this campus presentation, we delivered the knowledge of the synthetic biology and
						introduced the iGEM, which aroused the faculty and students' interest in the iGEM and synthetic biology. We also
						helped them establish the understanding of our project through this publicity activity, and collected a lot of
						valuable suggestions.</p>

					<p class="font-60">Kindergarten publicity</p>
					<p class="font-50">Purpose：</p>
					<p class="font-30">① Children's resistance to different diseases is relatively weak and thus they are easy to be
						infected with various infectious diseases. If an outbreak of an infectious disease took place in kindergartens,
						the consequences would be very unpredictable. Therefore, both kindergarten staff and the parents need to timely
						monitor the health and physical conditions of the children. Our nucleic acid testing method can help kindergarten
						staff and the parents detect the health conditions of the children conveniently.</p>
					<br /><br />
					<p class="font-30">② As there are a number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in our province, the service of the Binquan
						Kindergarten in Harbin has been suspended. In order to protect children from the infection and improve parents'
						awareness of COVVID-19 prevention, we held a joint online presentation in cooperation with the Binquan
						Kindergarten.</p>
					<br /><br />
					<p class="font-30">③ During the online presentation, our team members used their knowledge of biology to bring the
						children into the scientific field. We introduced what viruses are, how to prevent from their infection, and how
						to detect them, especially the novel SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we also explained our project and the synthetic
						biology related to our study to the parents.</p>

					<p class="font-50">Content:</p>
					<p class="font-30">At 16:00, October 3, 2021, the iGEM team from the College of Life Sciences, Northeast Forestry
						University, met the
						children from Binquan Kindergarten online to share scientific knowledge through the Tencent Conference platform.</p>
					<br /><br />
					<p class="font-30">First, Xiangxin Li used vivid pictures and essays to present the basic knowledge from what
						viruses are to how to
						prevent their infection, from outbreaks of new pneumonia to the suffering of the infected people, from the human
						and
						nature to the love and dedication. We hoped that the children could have general understanding of viruses and
						their
						imposed threats to our life through this special presentation.</p>
					<br /><br />
					<p class="font-30">Next, Xiangxin Li taught the children the correct way to wash their hands, the so-called "seven
						steps of washing technique". With our demonstration, the children actively followed us and also interacted with
						us. The children understood that washing hands could get rid of many harmful microorganisms, including viruses,
						and would like to develop a good habit of cleanliness and hygiene. Xiangxin Li described to the children
						regarding the novel Coronavirus, and explained its symptoms and detection methods. Xiangxin Li conveyed a lot of
						knowledge of the COVID-19 using her vivid language, so that the children could learn about the virus and become
						their own "health guards" through this relaxing and enjoyable online presentation.</p>
					<br /><br />
					<p class="font-30">Finally, Xiangxin Li introduced to the parents of the children about our project from the
						perspective of synthetic biology. A parent of a five-year-old child expressed great interest in our program. She
						said that with the availability of a convenient detection method, they could test their children at home for
						possible infection of most epidemic diseases, which would help the parents to know their children's physical
						condition in time. She looked forward to our program being put into use as soon as possible!</p>

						In addition to our usual public communications and campus publicity activities, we have also created several
						multimedia accounts to record the progress of our projects, increase our influence, and report our activities.
						During the publicity, we continue to propagate the knowledge of the synthetic biology, which not only made our
						team members to better understand our nucleic acid testing program, but also helped the readers or audiences have
						deep understanding of our program. A series of our tweets also made many of our partners more aware of our
						project development and the progress of our human practice. This year, we broadcasted our promotions mainly
						through the platforms of the Facebook, WeChat official account and Bilibili. Media publicity is an effective way
						to promote synthetic biology and expand the scope of its publicity. The NEFU_CHINA team will continue to innovate
						and expand our reach to bring synthetic biology to the forefront of biological research through heritage, now and
						in future.</p>
